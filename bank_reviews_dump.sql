58	The CBE app has been highly unreliable in recent weeks. It frequently fails to work properly on both Ethio Telecom and Safaricom networks, whether using Wi-Fi or mobile data. This week, the system was down entirely for extended periods, making it very difficult to access banking services. The app only functions intermittently, and the lack of consistency is frustrating. I hope the issues are addressed soon, and that any non-technical influences are removed from such essential services.	2	2025-05-25	negative	0.126	0.84	0.034	-0.7841	Account Access Issues, User Interface & Experience, Customer Support, Feature Requests	3

655	This is the worst mobile banking experience I‚Äôve ever had. It doesn‚Äôt work when you need it, and it randomly updates itself without warning. You can‚Äôt make transactions whenever you want. It‚Äôs a nightmare for anyone who relies on this as their main banking option, especially those with a lot of money in their account. I‚Äôm lucky I‚Äôm not one of them, but still, it‚Äôs infuriating not being able to access your money when you need it."l	1	2025-04-07	negative	0.085	0.86	0.055	-0.679	Account Access Issues, Transaction Performance, Feature Requests	4
